# Logging in on Wifi
If you are a uni student, you should already be able to login through `uniwide`
with your zID and password

# Logging in on Ethernet
If the organisers have done their job correctly, you should be able to plug in
your machine to a ethernet switch and gain access to ***TOP SPEEDS*** of 1gbps
up/down. To do this, you must first register your machine's MAC address to the
network

0.  Plug your machine into the switch. Please ask before you remove any cables.

1.  Confirm that a link to uniwide has been established over ethernet.

2.  Navigate to a site using http (NOT https). If all goes well, you should see
    a login page with the UNSW emblem.

3.  Login and restart your browser. Confirm that you can access the internet.

Note: You are still bound to
